# TANKS

# Introduction
This is an implementation of *TANKS!*, a two player (one keyboard) shooter game that was created at Unite Boston 2015 as a training session by Will Goldstone and and James Bouckley. The tutorial can be found [here](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/tanks-tutorial). Using the [Brain Game Center State Machine](https://github.com/UCRBrainGameCenter/BGC_Tools/tree/master/StateMachine), the AI contains several states such as dodge, flee, patrol, scan and more!
